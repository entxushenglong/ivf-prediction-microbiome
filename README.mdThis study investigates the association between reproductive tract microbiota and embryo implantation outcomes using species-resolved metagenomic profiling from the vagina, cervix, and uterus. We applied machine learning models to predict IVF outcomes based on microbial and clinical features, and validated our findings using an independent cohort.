This study investigates the association between reproductive tract microbiota and embryo implantation outcomes using species-resolved metagenomic profiling from the vagina, cervix, and uterus. We applied machine learning models to predict IVF outcomes based on microbial and clinical features, and validated our findings using an independent cohort.
